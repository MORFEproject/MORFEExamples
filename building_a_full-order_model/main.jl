# # Building a full-order model
#
# Every DPIM computation starts from the same three objects, and this tutorial builds all
# three from scratch:
# 
# - `MultilinearMap` — one nonlinear term of the equation of motion. Its `multiindex` says
#   which derivative fills each argument slot of `f!`.
# - `ExternalSystem` — the autonomous dynamics `ṙ = f(r)` that drives the model. Its linear
#   part **must be upper triangular** — a constraint the constructor satisfies by changing
#   coordinates itself when it has to.
# - `NthOrderModel` — the assembled `B_ORD x^(ORD) + … + B_0 x = F(x, ẋ, …, r)`.
# 
# The arc is: nonlinear terms → the driver → the assembled model → its response.
# 
#  1. `MultilinearMap`: what a multiindex means, drawn as force–displacement curves
#  2. `ExternalSystem`: harmonic, multiharmonic and quasi-periodic excitation, drawn as orbits
#  3. Chaotic excitation: a nonlinear driver, and the one coordinate change left to the caller
#  4. `NthOrderModel`: assemble a forced Duffing oscillator and integrate it
# 
# Everything is evaluated through the real library code — the curves come from `evaluate_term!`
# and `evaluate`, never from a formula written out a second time — and the coordinate changes
# are checked numerically rather than asserted.
# 
# Each section writes an interactive figure to `results/figures/`. Nothing is solved here:
# the script runs in a couple of seconds and needs no FEM backend.
