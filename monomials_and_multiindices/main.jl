# # Constructing MultiindexSets
#
# A `MultiindexSet` is the object that decides **which monomials the DPIM solve
# computes**. Every parametrisation `W` and reduced dynamics `R` carries one, and
# `parametrise(model, spectral, mset)` lets you supply your own instead of the
# default graded expansion — that single argument is the difference between an isotropic
# expansion, an anisotropic parametric ROM, and a spectrally truncated one.
# 
# This tutorial builds multiindex sets six ways, from the automatic generators to a
# spectral truncation driven by the superharmonics `s(α) = ⟨λ, α⟩`:
# 
#  1. the automatic generators
#  2. the same sets built by hand from a vector of exponents
#  3. combining conditions: anisotropic total degree × per-parameter box
#  4. removing multiindices with `delete_multiindices` and `filter`
#  5. bounding the superharmonics by a spectral radius
#  6. the `parametrise` contract, and how `validate_multiindex_set` enforces it
# 
# Each section writes an interactive lattice view to `results/figures/`. Nothing is
# solved here — the script runs in a couple of seconds and needs no FEM backend.

# MultiindexSet stores them sorted in graded-lexicographic (GrLex) order: total degree
# ascending first, then lexicographic *descending* within a degree. That order is what
# makes the cohomological solve causal — when the solver reaches α, every coefficient it
# needs at lower degree has already been computed.
